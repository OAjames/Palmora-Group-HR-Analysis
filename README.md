# Palmora-Group-HR-Analysis

The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company, is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. The media recently labelled the Group as “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”.
The CEO of Palmoria is keen to address these issues before they get out of hand. He hired me an HR Analyst expert to analyse the company’s HR data and come up with recommendations for management’s attention. 

The analysis was carried out using a Business Intelligence (BI) Tool using PowerBI.

## CASE SCENARIO

● Analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria management team would need to address the issues using appropriate visualiztion  

● Your focus should be on gender-related issues within the organization and its regions  

● Generally, there are two genders in the organization. However, some employees refused to disclose their gender. I had to assign a generic gender status to these employees

● Some employees are without a salary because they are no longer with the company. I had to take those employees out based on directive

● Lastly, some departments are indicated as “NULL”. These departments had to be taken out also based on the CEO directive.

### Problem Statements
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
   
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender

3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of
management

4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000
   
● Does Palmoria meet this requirement?

● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000.

● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000,
etc.?

● Also visualize this by regions

The CEO asked also if I could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the performance rating and handed me another data set that contains rules for making bonus payments and asked me to:

● Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees

● Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus)

● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
