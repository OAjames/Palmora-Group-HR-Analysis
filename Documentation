# Palmora Group HR Analysis Documentation

The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company, is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. The media recently labelled the Group as “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”.
The CEO of Palmoria is keen to address these issues before they get out of hand. He hired me an HR Analyst expert to analyse the company’s HR data and come up with recommendations for management’s attention. 

## CASE SCENARIO

● Analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria management team would need to address the issues using appropriate visualiztion
● Your focus should be on gender-related issues within the organization and its regions
● Generally, there are two genders in the organization. However, some employees refused to disclose their gender. I had to assign a generic gender status to these employees
● Some employees are without a salary because they are no longer with the company. I had to take those employees out based on directive
● Lastly, some departments are indicated as “NULL”. These departments had to be taken out also based on the CEO directive.
